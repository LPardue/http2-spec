# Shepherd Writeup for draft-ietf-httpbis-http2bis

## 1. Summary

Mark Nottingham is the document shepherd; Francesca Palombini is the responsible Area Director.

This specification describes an optimized expression of the semantics of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), referred to as HTTP version 2 (HTTP/2). HTTP/2 enables a more efficient use of network resources and a reduced latency by introducing field compression and allowing multiple concurrent exchanges on the same connection.

This document obsoletes RFC 7540 and RFC 8740, and is intended to be publishd as a Proposed Standard.


## 2. Review and Consensus

This document has enjoyed wide review and discussion among HTTP implementers and other Working Gropu participants. It benefits from the broad deployment of the protocol and the experiences of those deployments.


## 3. Intellectual Property

Both authors have confirmed that they have no direct, personal knowledge of any IPR related to this document.


## 4. Other Points

The document has an intentional reference to TLS 1.2, even though that document has been obsoleted by TLS 1.3.
